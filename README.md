# B42 protocol library #

B42 serial protocol implementation for Python3.

## Introduction ##

B42 is intended for bi-directional transmission of small command/data frames,
over byte based communication channels (such as serial),
with low latency and frame/protocol error detection.

B42 supports 16 commands with up to 18 bits data payload.

## Documentation ##

For the B42 Protocol Specification,
see [b42lib](https://github.com/amdx/b42lib/blob/main/docs/B42_protocol.pdf).

All classes and methods use Python Docstrings as API reference.

Examples are available under [examples/].
